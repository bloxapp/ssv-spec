# Message Justification Functions


## HighestPrepared

In the implementation, the only difference is the return value. Instead of returning the tuple (*prepared_round*,*prepared_value*), the function returns the signed message that contains such tuple.

## JustifyRoundChange

The same logic is applied in the implementation. The only difference is that the process doesn't look for received *Prepare* messages. Instead, the [*Round-Change* message structure](ROUND_CHANGE.md#structure) carries a list of *Prepare* messages that justifies its *prepared_round* and *prepared_value* attributes.


## JustifyPrePrepare

The implementation follows the same logic as the paper's specification. However, there are two observations:
- The $\beta$ predicate verification is included in the function implementation. This is done since such verification is implicit in the validation of *Pre-Prepare* messages.
- The quorum of *Round-Change* and *Prepare* messages are contained in the *Proposal* message itself. Look [here](PROPOSAL.md) for reference. Therefore, the node doesn't have to look for any message that it has received.
